abstract: "The GPR is an underground transmission radar that receives signals that are returned by reflective electromagnetic waves in the form of impulses emitted by transmitters. Due to the slow data processing speed of the GPR equipment currently in use, there is a problem with the slow speed of the exploration equipment. This causes the GPR exploration to cause road congestion.

<p>In order to secure these problems, this paper proposed and studied and designed a method for improving the speed of GPR receiver and increasing the acquisition rate of valid data. The study increased the acquisition rate of the effective data by making the signal desired to be obtained from the data obtained through the GPR equipment more pronounced using high-speed sampling and data accumulation. In addition, the data processed by two ADCs was reduced by the amount of data processed per ADC through four ADCs to increase the data processing speed.</p>

<p>Methods for improving the speed of GPR equipment proposed in this study and increasing the acquisition rate of effective data were studied, and the feasibility of implementing the methods studied through design and simulation was presented.</p>"
